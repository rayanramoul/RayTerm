# Get Started with one command (Linux and MacOS only)

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

The script will clone this repository and install ansible then prompt you to choose which part of the install you want to run. <br>
If you only want to check the dotfiles you can get them at this link : [Dotfiles](dotfiles) and for example run [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink your config with the repositories ones :

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/
cd RayTerm/dotfiles
stow -v -t ~ dotfiles
```

Or if you want a minimal setup for a server (only copy dotfiles) you can run the following command :

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/master/install.sh -O -)" -- -m
```

_for Windows you can check the [Windows](docs/Windows.md) doc_

# What is this ?

RayTerm is a set of configuration, dotfiles and software to ensure a vision on the optimal environement to code in.
It is :

- Tiling Window Management.
- Coherent and reproducible workflows from an OS to another.
- Strongly relying on terminal tools : Neovim, Tmux, Zsh, Fzf, etc.
- All prettier with Catppuccin !

# How ?

The idea is to have one main key associated with each part of the system

- `Alt` for the window manager.
- `Ctrl` for the terminal.
- `Ctrl + b` for tmux.
- `Ctrl` and `Space` for neovim.

# Docs

You can find my documentation of each part of my workflow in the [docs](docs) folder.

- [Terminal](docs/Terminal.md): My terminal configuration.
- [Tmux](docs/Tmux.md): My tmux configuration.
