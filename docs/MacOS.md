# How To Have Tiling Window Management and Keybindings
- Install [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) Tiling Window Manager, follow this [Tutorial](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(from-HEAD)) for example.
- (Optional) Another Tiling WM alternative is Amethyst but Yabai is better : https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Mouseless-MacOS-Window-Management-Yabai-vs-Amethyst/
- (For Apple Silicon users) If you are using a Mac with Apple Silicon you will have to run this : sudo nvram boot-args=-arm64e_preview_abi
- Install [SKHD](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) to set Yabai and system keybinds.

# Setup a Top Bar
You have 2 options :
## First Option - Simple Bar (Simple)
Works better out of the box without too much config or hassle.
- Install [Uebersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) this launcher will be helpful to setup the top bar.
- Install [Simple-Bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar), then you can configure it by clicking on it then CMD + ,
- Another potential bar is [Sketchy Bar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/tree/master).

## Second Option - SketchyBar (Similar to i3wm or GlazeWM bars)
I prefer it, configuration is a yaml file saved in ~/.config and also it better follows the behaviours of other twm i use
- Install following [this](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)


# (Optional) Have highlights on borders of apps to know which one is selected
- Install [Janky-Border](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders) this will help to highlight focused windows.
- Goo to System Prefs > Mission Control,
- Uncheck - Automatically rearrange
- Check - Displays have separate spaces

# Get my dotfiles
The dotfiles specific to Mac are mostly yabai [config](https://github.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/blob/master/dotfiles/.config/yabai/yabairc) and skhd [config](https://github.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/blob/master/dotfiles/.config/skhd/skhdrc) and sketchy bar [config](https://github.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/blob/master/dotfiles/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc) ones, i reproduce with them what i have on i3wm and glazewm.
## First Option - With install.sh script
- Setup dotfiles, in your terminal launch :
```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/master/install.sh -O -)"
```
The script will clone this repository and install ansible then prompt you to choose which part of the install you want to run. <br>

## Second Option - Use Stow
If you only want to check the dotfiles you can get them at this link : [Dotfiles](dotfiles) and for example run [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink your config with the repositories ones :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayanramoul/RayTerm/
cd RayTerm
stow -t $HOME -R dotfiles
```
- Now reload yabai and skbhd services
```bash
yabai --restart-service
skhd --restart-service
```
